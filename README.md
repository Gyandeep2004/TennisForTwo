• Design a user-friendly interface and intuitive controls for local two-player gameplay. 
3. Apply Game Development Principles 
• Gain practical experience in areas such as game loops, rendering, collision detection, 
and input handling. 
4. Incorporate Modern Enhancements 
• Improve visual presentation with updated graphics. 
• Add sound effects or background music for a more engaging experience. 
• Optionally include features like CRT-style filters, AI opponent, or settings menu. 
5. Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility 
• Build the game to run smoothly on different operating systems (if applicable), ensuring 
stability and performance. 
6. Document the Development Process 
• Maintain clear documentation of the design, implementation, and testing phases for 
academic and technical reference. 
7. Celebrate and Preserve Gaming History
